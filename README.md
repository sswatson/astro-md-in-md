# Importing MDX from MDX files in Astro

This repo provides a minimal example showing how to import MDX in MDX. It works quite well except that component substitutions don't apply recursively, so the user has to apply them every time they use a component.

## How to run

1. Clone the repo
2. Do `pnpm install`
3. Do `pnpm dev`
