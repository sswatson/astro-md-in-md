import Counter from "@/components/Counter";
import InnerMarkdown from "@/fragments/inner-markdown.mdx";
import Code from "@/components/Code.astro";

This MDX file is being imported directly by an Astro component.

```python
def test():
    return "Hello, world!"
```

<InnerMarkdown components={{pre: Code}}/>

This is the same thing, but without explicit component substitution:

<InnerMarkdown />
